Formidable
==========
API to map case classes to/from a 'layout' of HTMLInput elements and Scala.Rx Vars. It is akin in purpose to the playframework form library, but entirely done in Scala.js... and a rather different approach in API. 

Getting Started
==============

```scala
 "com.stabletechs" %%% "formidable" % "0.0.11"
```
formidable is only compiled for Scala.js 0.6+
